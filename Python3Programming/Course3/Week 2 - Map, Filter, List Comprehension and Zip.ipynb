    "Let’s revisit the accumulator pattern. We have frequently taken a list and produced another list from it that contains either a subset of the items or a transformed version of each item. When each item is transformed we say that the operation is a **mapping, or just a map** of the original list. When some items are omitted, we call it a **filter**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides built-in functions `map` and `filter`. Python also provides a new syntax, called **list comprehensions**, that lets you express a mapping and/or filtering operation. Just as with named functions and lambda expressions, some students seem to find it easier to think in terms of the map and filter functions, while other students find it easier to read and write list comprehensions. You’ll learn both ways; one may even help you understand the other. Most python programmers use list comprehensions, so make sure you learn to read those. In this course, you can choose to learn to write list comprehensions or to use map and filter, whichever you prefer. You should learn to read both list comprehensions and map/filter.\n",

Most places in Python where you can use a list (e.g., in a for loop) you can use an “iterator” as if it was actually a list. So you probably won’t ever notice the difference. If you ever really need a list, you can explicitly turn the output of map into a list: `list(map(...))`. In the runestone environment, map actually returns a real list, but to make this code compatible with a full python environment, we always convert it to a list."
